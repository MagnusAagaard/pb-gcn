# Part-based Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-based Action Recognition

Official repository for the code from BMVC (British Machine Vision Conference) paper "[Part-based Graph Convolutional Network for Action Recognition](http://bmvc2018.org/contents/papers/1003.pdf)". The implementation is done in Pytorch. The repository includes:

- [ ] Code for the model used in paper for comparison to state-of-the-art.
- [ ] Model checkpoints for model trained on NTURGB+D Cross Subject and Cross View data splits.
- [ ] Training and testing code for both NTURGB+D and HDM05 datasets.
- [ ] Data preparation scripts for both the datasets so that they can be used with Pytorch.
- [ ] Notebook examples for understanding the workflow of the model training and testing, as well as data preparation.
